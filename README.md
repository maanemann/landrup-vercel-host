# Examn project, Hans August
For our final examn in front-end development we had a week to build this fitness dance app. I was granted the grade of 12, which is as good as it gets (just bragging).

- The project UI is found here: `/landrup_root`. Note that this is not a design assignment, the job was to closely imitate the supplied Figma file.
- The API that was handed out, containing activity data, user/trainer data etc, is located at `/landrup-root/landrup-dans-api`.
- To launch the project, run `npm run dev` in the UI folder (set to port 3000) and `npm start` in the API folder (set to port 4000).
- It is also hosted at https://landrup-vercel-host.vercel.app/.
- Note that it is optimized for a 411x823 screen res, matching the supplied Figma file, but given the dynamic CSS values I've used, it works faily well in other formats as well.
- The files in this (root) folder are mostly assignment specifications, if you're interested, though they're written in Danish.
- `Dokumentation.md` (Danish) is the project documentation written by me. It was part of the assignment and includes my tech stack, description of it, code highlight, my own additions and corrections, chosen optional assignment(s), as well as a reflection. 
- I like to write a lot of comments to better remember my intentions of the code, you will see these when reading through the project files. They too are written in Danish.
